# **App Name**: AgriChain Connect

## Core Features:

- Farmer/MSME Onboarding: Firebase Auth with phone + OTP + Aadhaar verification (via third-party API like Signzy or Juspay). Multilingual forms (English, Hindi, मराठी) with voice-to-text input using Web Speech API (offline-capable). Offline-first data sync to Firestore using local persistence. Blockchain identity registration: After verification, store a hash of Aadhaar and profile on-chain (via smart contract) for immutable identity proof. Role assignment in Firebase + blockchain (via Cloud Function). Onboarding tutorial/demo mode with voice guidance.
- Product Listing & Marketplace: Firestore-powered marketplace with real-time filtering (category, location, freshness, certification). AI Pricing Hints fetched via Remote Config and displayed as dynamic suggestions. Blockchain-backed product creation: When a product is listed, trigger a smart contract to record: Product ID, farmer ID, timestamp, quality cert hash Return transaction hash stored in Firestore for UI verification. Firebase Storage for image uploads with automatic compression and IPFS backup (optional). Provenance badge on product card showing “Verified on Blockchain”. Sustainability tags (e.g., “Organic”, “Zero Waste”) linked to future token rewards.
- Buyer Experience: Guest browsing allowed: No login required to view products or add to cart. Fast search using Algolia or Firestore composite indexes. Product page with: Static metadata (SSG/SSR for fast load) Dynamic IoT data (real-time from Firestore) Blockchain authenticity badge (fetched via Cloud Function from smart contract) Farmer profile and ratings. Add to Cart with localStorage persistence for guests. Checkout triggers Firebase Auth (sign-in or one-tap sign-up). Favorites & Notifications via Firestore collections + FCM. Escrow payment flow: After order, funds go to smart contract; UI shows “Payment Secured in Escrow”.
- Logistics Tracking: Simulated live GPS & IoT feed (temperature, humidity) pushed to Firestore every 30s. Map view with Google Maps API (lazy-loaded for performance). IoT data snapshots hashed and stored on blockchain every 30 mins via Cloud Function. Delivery confirmation via QR scan: Updates Firestore shipment status Triggers smart contract to verify delivery and release escrow payment Logs delivery proof on blockchain. Condition alerts if IoT data goes out of range (e.g., temp > 5°C for cold chain).
- AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing: Use LSTM or Prophet model (hosted via Cloud Run or Vertex AI) to predict demand and price trends. Pricing hints pre-fetched and cached via Remote Config. Smart contract integration: Pricing logic (base + AI suggestion + community rating) stored in blockchain for transparency Farmers can accept or override, but final price is recorded on-chain. Price history viewable on product page with blockchain verification
- Multilingual Toggle: Language toggle for English, Hindi, मराठी (expandable). Static content translation via i18n or Firebase Remote Config. Voice command support in all languages using Web Speech API. AI-powered dynamic translation of reviews or chat using HuggingFace or Google Translate API (optional)
- Admin & Fraud Monitoring: Admin dashboard with: User verification queue (Aadhaar, product approval) AI fraud alerts (anomalies in pricing, duplicate listings) Blockchain audit trail (transaction explorer). Fraud data hashed and stored on-chain for tamper-proof logging
- Offline & Accessibility: Offline-first design: Firestore local persistence for cart, forms, and product data. Voice navigation and input in all core flows. Large text, high contrast, and screen reader support
- Demo & Presentation Mode: Auto-play demo showing: Farmer listing product → buyer purchasing → escrow → delivery → payment release Blockchain verification at each step. Slide deck and video walkthrough ready for hackathon
- Blockchain Core: Smart Contracts (Solidity on Polygon): IdentityRegistry: Stores verified user hashes ProductProvenance: Records product creation and ownership EscrowPayment: Holds and releases funds based on delivery and IoT conditions SustainabilityToken: ERC-20 token for green practices ReputationSystem: Immutable ratings Cloud Functions to: Listen to Firestore events and call smart contracts Verify blockchain transaction status and update Firestore Trigger FCM on key events (payment released, delivery confirmed)
